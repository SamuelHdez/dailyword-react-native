# Daily Word

DailyWord is a mobile implementation of the popular word guessing game, Wordle. Built with React Native and Expo, this game challenges players to guess a target word in six tries or less. Each attempt provides visual feedback, marking each letter as correct in position, correct in word but incorrect position, or completely missing the target word.
